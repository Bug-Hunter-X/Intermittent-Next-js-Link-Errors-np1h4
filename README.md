# Intermittent Next.js Link Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js application where links intermittently fail to navigate to the correct page.  The `About` page, for instance, sometimes results in a 404 error.

## Bug Description

The issue is characterized by unpredictable behavior of Next.js links.  While they often work correctly, there are instances where clicking links does not trigger the expected page navigation, instead returning a 404. The issue's inconsistency makes it challenging to debug.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the navigation behavior of the links to the Home and About pages. The issue may manifest inconsistently. Note the conditions under which the error occurs.

## Solution

A solution involving a careful check of the `pages` directory structure, appropriate routing configuration, and ensuring the `About` page is correctly implemented and exported is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
